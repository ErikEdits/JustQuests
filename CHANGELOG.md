## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

First public release. A lightweight, datapack-driven quest book for
NeoForge 1.21.1 — command-only, no GUI yet.

### Added
- Datapack-driven quests loaded from
  `data/<namespace>/justquests/quests/<id>.json`
- `collect_item` objective type (counts items picked up from the ground)
- `give_item` reward type (drops at the player's feet if the inventory
  is full)
- Per-player progress stored via a NeoForge data attachment, persists
  across logout and survives death
- Commands: `/quest list` (shows each quest's description, goal and
  reward), `/quest progress`, `/quest accept <id>`,
  `/quest abandon <id>`, `/quest reload`
- Quest ids use tab completion (`accept` suggests all quests, `abandon`
  suggests your active ones)
- 10 bundled starter quests (first_steps → ender_seeker)
- Mod icon

### Notes
- Objectives track items **picked up from the ground** (mining, crops,
  mob drops). Crafted items go straight to the inventory and do not
  count — design quests around gathering.
- NeoForge 1.21.1 only. More loaders and MC versions are planned.
